Create a comprehensive MLOps pipeline for machine learning model deployment with the following specifications:

**Project Requirements:**
- Implement a complete MLOps pipeline for ML model deployment
- Support model versioning, CI/CD integration, and monitoring
- Include A/B testing and scalable deployment capabilities
- Provide production-ready infrastructure and security

**Technical Architecture:**
- Data Pipeline: Ingestion, validation, feature engineering, versioning
- Model Development: Experiment tracking, training, validation, selection
- Model Deployment: Packaging, containerization, serving, scaling
- Monitoring: Performance monitoring, drift detection, alerting

**Key Features to Implement:**
1. End-to-end ML lifecycle automation
2. Model versioning and registry
3. CI/CD integration and deployment
4. Real-time monitoring and alerting
5. A/B testing and experimentation
6. Scalable cloud-native deployment

**Code Structure:**
- pipeline/mlops_pipeline.py - Main pipeline orchestration
- registry/model_registry.py - Model versioning and storage
- deployment/model_serving.py - Model serving and API
- monitoring/performance_monitoring.py - Performance tracking
- monitoring/drift_detection.py - Data and model drift
- testing/ab_testing.py - A/B testing framework
- infrastructure/kubernetes.py - K8s deployment
- security/security_manager.py - Security and compliance

**MLOps Components to Support:**
- Data Pipeline (ingestion, validation, transformation)
- Model Registry (versioning, metadata, storage)
- Model Serving (REST API, batch processing)
- Monitoring (performance, drift, alerts)
- A/B Testing (experimentation, comparison)
- Infrastructure (Kubernetes, Docker, cloud)

**Advanced Techniques:**
- Infrastructure as Code (Terraform, K8s)
- GitOps for deployment and configuration
- Service Mesh for microservices communication
- Observability (Prometheus, Grafana, Jaeger)
- Security (RBAC, network policies, secrets)

**Deployment Strategies:**
- Blue-green deployment
- Canary deployment
- Rolling updates
- Traffic splitting

**Monitoring Features:**
- Model performance tracking
- Data drift detection
- System health monitoring
- Business metrics tracking
- Alert management

**Security and Compliance:**
- Role-based access control
- Network security policies
- Secrets management
- Audit logging
- Regulatory compliance

Include comprehensive documentation, deployment guides, and production best practices.
