# MNIST-NN

Practice project for understanding the inner-workings of a Neural Network. Developed from scratch, only using libraries such as numpy and pandas for basic math and matrix multiplication and matplotlib.

From this project I learned:
 - How to utilize functions in pandas
 - The math behind every process of a Neural Network
 - Performing a training/testing split for supervised learning
 - Initialize the parameters of a Neural Network
 - How forward propagation and backpropagation works
 - Troubleshooting my code
