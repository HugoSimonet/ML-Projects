Create a comprehensive multi-modal vision-language model implementation with the following specifications:

**Project Requirements:**
- Implement a state-of-the-art Vision-Language Model that can understand and generate text descriptions of images
- Support image captioning, visual question answering, and cross-modal retrieval
- Use PyTorch with transformer architectures (CLIP-style models)
- Include attention mechanisms and cross-modal fusion layers

**Technical Architecture:**
- Vision Encoder: Pre-trained ResNet-50 or ViT backbone with feature extraction
- Language Encoder: BERT or GPT-style transformer with bidirectional context
- Cross-Modal Fusion: Multi-head cross-attention layers for vision-language alignment
- Task-Specific Heads: Caption generation, VQA, and retrieval heads

**Key Features to Implement:**
1. Contrastive learning for vision-language alignment
2. Multi-head attention for cross-modal interactions
3. Data augmentation for both vision and text
4. Transfer learning with pre-trained models
5. Comprehensive evaluation metrics (BLEU, METEOR, CIDEr, ROUGE-L)

**Code Structure:**
- models/vision_encoder.py - Vision processing
- models/language_encoder.py - Text processing  
- models/cross_modal_fusion.py - Cross-modal attention
- models/task_heads.py - Task-specific outputs
- training/trainer.py - Training pipeline
- evaluation/metrics.py - Evaluation metrics
- inference/generator.py - Inference and generation
- data/datasets.py - Data loading and preprocessing

**Datasets to Support:**
- COCO Captions (330K images with 5 captions each)
- VQA v2.0 (Visual question answering)
- Flickr30K (Additional image-caption pairs)

**Performance Targets:**
- BLEU-4: 0.35+, METEOR: 0.28+, CIDEr: 1.20+, ROUGE-L: 0.55+
- VQA Accuracy: 70%+ on VQA v2.0 test set
- Cross-Modal Retrieval: 60%+ R@1 for image-to-text, 50%+ for text-to-image

Include comprehensive documentation, example usage, and visualization tools for attention weights and generated outputs.
