# ML-Projects

A collection of Machine Learning projects that I've worked on over the years. More information on each project is provided in the README's in each project's folder.

 - [License Plate Recognition](https://github.com/HugoSimonet/ML-Projects/tree/main/ALPR): Algorithm that reads an image of a car with a visible license plate, locates the license plate, then reads the characters on the license plate and returns a string.
 - [MNIST-NN](https://github.com/HugoSimonet/ML-Projects/tree/main/MNIST-NN): Neural Network without machine learning libraries to detect numbers in the MNIST dataset.
